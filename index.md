## Welcome to My Blog

I am trying to learn the programming again. Things have changed quite a bit since the time I did any programming. I did not do any programming actively since 2002. I was formally trained in Oracle, C, C++ and mainframe programming (COBOL, DB2, IMS DB/DC, CICS etc.,) between 1996 and 1998. Soon after the education and training,  I started worked for UK insurance giant where I had to do mainframe programming. I continued to do small, medium projects and some maintenance work. I became busy managing and delivering the projects but my urge to come back to programming was always there. I am hoping to get my hands dirty and do some programming this time.

I am using the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pyarravajhala/pyarravajhala.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/pyarravajhala/pyarravajhala.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
